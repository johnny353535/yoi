# To Do

## Components

- [ ] remove a couple of very shop-centric components (pricetag, etc.)
- [ ] add Toc
- [ ] add horizontal menu with overflow-scroll and scroll indicators

## Implement less Plugins

- [ ] https://github.com/less/less-plugin-npm-import (can be used in less' import statements, on the cli or in node scripts)
- [ ] https://github.com/atlassian/less-plugin-inline-svg (inlines SVG images with variable support)

## Most Urgent

- [x] add license
- [ ] move away from bower
- [ ] implement icons as svg inline icons (see above)
- [ ] update build scripts
- [ ] refactor/rebuild slider
- [ ] look into: all utilities as additional mixins?
- [x] review, improve, refactor grid utilities
- [x] write utilities intro page

## Nice to Have

- [ ] expand JSfiddle integration
- [ ] add "invert colors" option to each component
- [ ] more constructor mixins
- [ ] add upload to kit build process (via unix/bash script instead of node.js script)
- [ ] redraw & refactor icons

## Improvements

- [ ] add option to enable/disable behaviors depending on current breakpoint
- [ ] add public destroy() method to each component and behaviour

## Future Roadmap

- [x] gradient tool gets it's own repository
- [ ] refactor JS (modern syntax, modules, transpile via Babel?)
- [ ] make markup more accessible (according to [a11y checklist](http://a11yproject.com/checklist.html))
