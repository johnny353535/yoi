# YOI Userdocs Style Guide

## General Rules

- Write as clear and simple as possible. Write as brief as possible. Write only as much as necessary.

- Use active voice instead of passive voice.
- Write in present tense. Avoid the word *will*.
- Write in second person and address the reader directly.
- Use imperative language, eg.: *use this component to achieve x*.
- Put conditional clauses before instructions, not after.
- Always link proprietary terms (eg. *behavior*) to the glossary page.
- Be consistent with the (technical) terms you use.
- Start each page with a precise headline, followed by a brief summary/introduction paragraph.
