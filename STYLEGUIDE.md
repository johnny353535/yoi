## General Rules

- Write as clear and simple as possible. Write as brief as possible. Write only as much as necessary.
- Use active voice instead of passive voice.
- Write in present tense. Avoid the word *will*.
- Write in second person and address the reader directly (*you*).
- Use imperative language, eg.: *use this component to achieve x*.
- Always link proprietary terms (eg. *behaviour*) to the glossary page.
- Start each page with a precise headline, followed by a brief summary/introduction paragraph.
