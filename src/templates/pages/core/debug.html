## Visual Debugging
Use the [option variables](/pages/theme/options.html) of your [theme](/pages/theme/_introduction.html) to include styles that are only applied if certain _debug flags_ were set. You can highlight BEM-style elements (__elements, --modifiers), certain utility classes or even display the currently active media query.
