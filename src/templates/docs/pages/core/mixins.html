## Mixins
Mixins are reusable snippets of CSS code. They are a [Less language feature](http://lesscss.org/features/#mixins-feature).

|                |                                             |
| -              | -                                           |
| Less-File      | [mixins.less](assets/less/core/mixins.less) |

### Helper Mixins

#### .mixin-clearfix
Use this mixin to add the popular [micro clearfix hack](http://cssmojo.com/the-very-latest-clearfix-reloaded/).

#### .mixin-hidden
Use this mixin to _visually_ hide elements. These elements are still accessible by screenreaders.

### Media Query Mixins

| Mixin               | Media Query                                       |
| -                   | -                                                 |
| .mixin-smallScreen  | @bpSmall = "only screen and (max-width: 800px)"   |
| .mixin-mediumScreen | @bpMedium = "only screen and (min-width: 801px)"  |
| .mixin-largeScreen  | @bpLarge = "only screen and (min-width: 960px)"   |
| .mixin-xLargeScreen | @bpXLarge = "only screen and (min-width: 1220px)" |

If you create a new element, you migh want to add __different styling depending on the screen size__ and therefore active media query. You can do so by using the pre-defined _media query mixins_. These mixins **use breakpoint variables** which were defined in [variables/breakpoints.less](assets/less/variables/breakpoints.less)

<div class="documentation__block"><code class="language-less"><pre>
.myElement {

    width: 100%;

    .mixin-xLargeScreen({
        width: auto;
        max-width: 120rem;
    });

}
</pre></code></div>

{% markdown %}
The breakpoint mixins __accept rulesets as parameter__. This is a Less language feature: [Passing Rulesets to Mixins](http://lesscss.org/features/#detached-rulesets-feature).

<div class="note note--negative note--large note--icon085 m-t-8">
    <h3 class="note__headline">Semicolon!</h3>
    <div class="note__body">
        <p>Always add a semicolon right after the breakpoint mixin to avoid syntax errors from the Less parser.</p>
    </div>
</div>
