## How to Use This Documentation
This documentation was thoughtfully written and structured to make it easy to read and understand. It’s written in English – like all inline comments inside the code files.

### Examples
Examples can be found on most pages. They can display both the rendered element and it’s markup. The code featues syntax-hightlighting for better readability.

```html
<span class="elementClassname">element</span>
```

### Hints
Notes display important information – restrictions, possible browser quirks, best practices, etc.
