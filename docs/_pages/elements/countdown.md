## Countdown
Use this element to create a countdown to a date, less than a year ahead. The countdown is rendered as a lcd-style clock, yet fully accessible via screen readers.

| Base CSS-Class | `.countdown`                                                                |
| Modifiers      | `-`                                                                         |

### Basic Example
Create an element with the css class name `countdown`. One parameter is needed, supplied via the custom yoi-attribute: the date of the deadline, [ISO 8601 formatted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString).

```html
<div class="countdown" yoi-countdown="year:2017; month:3; day:8;"></div>
```

<p class="hint"><b>Limitations</b> Please notice that while the countdown can process deadline more than a year in the future, it was <i>designed to count down to an event less than 12 months in the future</i>.</p>

### Countdown With Optional Title
Add an element with the css class name `countdown__title` to add an optional title.

```html
<div class="countdown" yoi-countdown="year:2020; month:12; day:31; hour:15;">
    <p class="countdown__title">Time Until Takeoff:</p>
</div>
```

### Expired Countdown
Once the countdown expired, the display will reset and the **custom event** `countdown:expired` **will fire**.

```html
<div class="countdown" yoi-countdown="year:2001; month:12; day:31; hour:15;"></div>
```

### Progressive Enhancement, Accessibility & Fallback
Each lcd-style digit is an svg graphic. To make the countdown more accessible by default, the script inserts a visually hidden label with a well-readable string, representing the remaining time. However, itâ€™s a good idea to always include this label to provide a meaningful noScript-fallback:

```html
<div class="countdown" yoi-countdown="year:2001; month:12; day:31; hour:15;">
    <p class="hidden">Expires on December 31st 2020 at 15:00 GMT+0002.</p>
</div>
```

Once the script is executed, the label gets replaced and updates every second:

```html
<div class="countdown" yoi-countdown="year:2001; month:12; day:31; hour:15;">
    <p class="hidden">Expires on January 1st, 2020 at 15:00 GMT+0002</p>
</div>
```
