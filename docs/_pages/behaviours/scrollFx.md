# Scrollfx

<p class="intro">Adds effects or transitions to an element, responding to the scrolling position.</p>

## Parameters

| `in`     | The effect to apply when the element scrolls into the viewport                                                                    |
| `center` | The effect to apply when the element is at the center of the viewport                                                             |
| `out`    | The effect to apply when the element scrolls out of the viewport                                                                  |
| `speed`  | Change the duration of all effects to `fast` or `slow`                                                                            |
| `repeat` | By default, the effects play each time on in/center/out. If you wish to apply them only once on in/center/out, set it to `false`. |

### In, Center, Out

Each element can have up to three effects. One for `in`, `center` and `out`.

For example, an effect on `in` plays when the element scrolls into the visible area of the page â€“ no matter if you scroll up or down. `out` is the opposite (element leaves the visible area), while `center` applies the effect when the element aligns with the vertical center of the visible area. 

The following example will apply a effect `fx-fade-in` on `center`:

```html
<!-- example -->
<div class="bg-green-15 br h-10" yoi-scrollfx="center:fade-in;"></div>
```

### Speed

Add the Parameter `speed` to change the duration of all effects to either `slow` or `fast`:

```html
<!-- example -->
<div class="bg-blue-17 br m-b-2 h-10" yoi-scrollfx="center:slide-in-left; speed:slow;"></div>
<div class="bg-yellow-18 br h-10" yoi-scrollfx="center:slide-in-right; speed:fast;"></div>
```

### Repeat

By default, the effects play each time on `in`, `center` or `out`. Add the parameter `repeat` and set it to `false` to make the effect play only once:

```html
<!-- example -->
<div class="bg-purple-18 br h-10" yoi-scrollfx="center:flip-in-x; repeat:false;"></div>
```
