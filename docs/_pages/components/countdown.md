# Countdown

<p class="intro">Use this component to create a countdown to a future date less than a year ahead. The countdown is rendered as a lcd-style clock, yet fully accessible via screen readers.</p>

## Basic Example

This is how a basic `.countdown` looks like and how you write the markup:

```html
<!-- example -->
<div class="countdown" yoi-countdown="year:{{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }}; month:12; day:31;"></div>
```

<p class="hint hint--negative"><b>Limitations</b> Please notice that while the countdown was <i>designed to count down to an event less than 12 months in the future</i>.</p>

## Countdown With Optional Title

Add an element with the css class name `countdown__title` to add an optional title.

```html
<!-- example -->
<div class="countdown" yoi-countdown="year:{{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }}; month:12; day:31; hour:15;">
    <p class="countdown__title">Time Until Takeoff:</p>
</div>
```

## Expired Countdown

Once the countdown expired, the display will reset and the *custom event* `yoi-countdown:expire` *will fire* (JavaScript).

```html
<!-- example -->
<div class="countdown" yoi-countdown="year:2001; month:12; day:31; hour:15;"></div>
```

## Progressive Enhancement, Accessibility & Fallback

Each lcd-style digit is an svg graphic. To make the countdown more accessible by default, the script inserts a visually hidden label with a well-readable string, representing the remaining time. However, itâ€™s a good idea to always include this label to provide a meaningful noScript-fallback:

```html
<!-- example -->
<div class="countdown" yoi-countdown="year:{{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }}; month:12; day:31; hour:15;">
    <p class="hidden">Expires on December 31st {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }} at 15:00 GMT+0002.</p>
</div>
```

Once the script is executed, the label gets replaced and updates every second:

```html
<!-- example -->
<div class="countdown" yoi-countdown="year:{{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }}; month:12; day:31; hour:15;">
    <p class="hidden">Expires on January 1st, {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }} at 15:00 GMT+0002</p>
</div>
```
