# Quotation

<p class="intro">Styled block quotes.</p>

## Basic Example

This is how a basic `.quotation` looks like and how you write the markup:

```html
<!-- example -->
<div class="quotation">
    <p>Thus the photons which constitute a ray of light behave like intelligent human beings: out of all possible curves, they always select the one which will take them most quickly to their goal.</p>
    <p>â€“ Max Planck</p>
</div>
```
